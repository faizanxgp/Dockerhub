# How to Deploy DockerHub and GitHub To Work Side-By-Side

It’s important to keep personal access tokens (PATs) secure and not share them publicly or in unsecured environments, such as emails and unencrypted channels, including posting on forums or public repositories.

**For security reasons, you should first:**

## Create a New Token: Create a new personal access token with the appropriate permissions.

### You can go to your GitHub profile settings.

- Navigate to Developer settings > Personal access tokens.
- Click on Generate new token.
- Provide the necessary scopes (e.g., repo scope for private repositories).
- Save the token securely.

**Now that you have secured a new token but want to integrate GitHub with Docker, follow the instructions mentioned, but remember to manage your token securely. Let me remind you how to set up the GitHub Actions pipeline with sensitive data securely:**

## Setting Up GitHub Actions for Docker Integration

**Add Repository Secrets: Since we must authenticate with Docker Hub and GitHub itself (only necessary if using additional GitHub APIs requiring your token), keep this new token safe and store it under GitHub repository secrets.**

### You can go to your GitHub repository.

- Click on Settings > Secrets and Variables> Actions.
- Click New Repository secret.
- Name DOCKER_USERNAME: Your Docker Hub username.
- Name DOCKER_PASSWORD: Your Docker Hub password.
- (Optional) If using the GitHub API directly, add another secret:
- Name GITHUB_TOKEN: Your new personal access token.
- Configure GitHub Actions Workflow:

## Please store your desired workflow definition in a file.

- Follow diligent security practices when using tokens. 
- You can invalidate your tokens when your workflows no longer need them or when you detect any suspicious activity.
- Tools like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or Azure Key Vault may provide robust solutions for the persistent or automated use of sensitive credentials.

### Addendum: 
The steps and examples assume you’re familiar with respective syntax and conventions within YAML files and workflow configuration per GitHub community standards. 
Could you confirm v2 or current Docker login actions with official GitHub repository documentation for confirmation and recent updates?
